benchmarking - problem

- based on to many variables
- sometimes its impossible / not feasible

how to - we talk about algorithms

- scientist likes impossible stuff - big numbers
- objective with to judge / rank algorithms

my friend wants to catch up on GOT

- no netflix - no hbo - no foxtel

- just the first season - input - sample size

1. snail mail delivery

- 1 day

  1. goto website
  2. wait a day
  3. walk to mail box
  4. win

> time constant 0(1)

> logarithmic time O(log n)

2. torrenting - for educational purposes

- 10 hours - 20 hours ? ~ 30 hours

  1. open vpn
  2. goto favorite torrent site
  3. download
  4. win

  > time linear 0(n + 1 + 1 + 1)

> O(n^2) quadtratic

- nested loop

> O(2^n) exponential

- length n
- cracking passwords
- 10 character password
- O(2^10)

> O(n!)

- times square
- SOL
- empire state building
- CP
- soup

ts sol esb cp
ts esb sol cp

- factorial
- 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
- 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

- 25 X 24 X 23 X 22 X 21 ...

# big O notation

# asymptotic upper bound

- sample size gets very large !!!!!!
- more interested in the worst case

> something that is possible to completly no frickin way

# comp sci

# trades off

# data structures & algorithms
